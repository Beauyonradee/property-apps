# Property Listing App (iOS)

This project is an iOS mobile application developed for the **COIT20270 Practical Assignment** at Central Queensland University.
The app displays a list of real estate properties and allows users to view details, filter by type, and manage a personalized
"watch list". The application was developed using **Swift** and **Xcode**, and property data is loaded from a local **JSON file**.

## Features

- Tabbed interface with:
  - **Properties** tab (all available listings)
  - **Property Watch** tab (user-selected saved properties)
- **Segmented filters** for:
  - All
  - House
  - Unit
  - Land
- **Single tap** on a property opens a detailed view
- **Double tap** adds a property to the watch list
- **Add New Property** functionality via "+" button:
  - User can enter address, price, and type
  - Default image used for new listings
- **Swipe left** on a property to delete
- Data is managed through a **JSON file** included in the app bundle
